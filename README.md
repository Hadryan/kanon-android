# Kanon (Android)

Kanon is a simple Android app that teaches musical sight reading.

## Usage

Get the very buggy, featureless beta version of Kanon from [Google Play][].
Minimum API level 15 (Android 4.0.3, Ice Cream Sandwich, released 2011 Dec).

Select the size and quality that matches the interval you see on the screen.
Enter the settings menu to change the clef, adjust allowed note ranges, select
allowed intervals and pitches, and much, much more (to come in the future)!

### Features

- Three different clefs! No tenor clef, because who cares about tenors!
- Adjust different allowed note ranges for each clef, using the
standard scientific pitch notation that nobody uses and nobody knows!
- Select the same allowed intervals and pitches for every clef! You have to!
- Never crashes unexpectedly! You should always expect it to crash!!
- No ledger lines allowed!!!
